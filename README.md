# 🐻 CyberBear: Gamifying Cybersecurity Awareness for Safer Online Practices 🛡️

Welcome to **CyberBear**, a gamified platform designed to educate users on cybersecurity through interactive games, quizzes, and a fine-tuned LLM chatbot assistant. This project aims to make learning cybersecurity engaging and effective, targeting individuals, educational institutions, and businesses alike.

CyberBear was co-founded and developed by Aditi Chhawacharia and Vinay Khanagavi and is where cybersecurity education meets interactive learning designed specifically for youth! In a digital world where over 95% of teens have access to smartphones and over 45% report being online "almost constantly," cybersecurity education has never been more critical. Yet studies show that only 23% of schools offer digital safety programs. We believe that cybersecurity awareness doesn't have to be complicated or boring. Through our gamified approach, we transform internet safety concepts into fun, interactive experiences that make learning both enjoyable and effective. Our platform features specially designed games, quizzes, and interactive lessons that simplify cybersecurity concepts in ways that connect with children and teens.

   <h1>Sam Made a Dangerous Choice</h1>
    <p>
      Sam agreed to meet someone he met online… but they weren’t who they said they were.  
      They tricked him into sharing personal info and set a trap.  
      Sam was taken by a stranger. His family was terrified, and the police had to find him.
      <br><br>
      <strong>This could’ve been avoided.</strong> Never meet online strangers, and always tell a trusted adult if someone suspicious contacts you.
